===FoyerIntro===
    The mansion interior recalls the cold, white stone of a museum more than the warmth and furnishings of a home. The entryway is punctuated by marble statues, and a portrait of Maximilian hangs at the end of the hallway, framed in gold. However, Maximilian pays no attention to these garnishments and keeps his gaze on me.  
    “Tell me, old chap, how has that old detective fling been treating you? We simply <i>must</i> catch up, it’s been too long!”
     * [Explain] "Well..."
        The Butler catches the two of us from behind, saving me from explaining my own dull livelihood. 
        "Sir, I expect you'll be pleased to know that this evening's peparations are complete." He looks me up and down before gesturing towards a grand pedestal. The item seated atop it is a mystery to me, hidden behind a red velvet curtain.
        “You have my gratitude. Oh, and do take this coat.” Max turns to wink at me as he hands away my coat. "This is that cake I warned you about." 
        "I've already seen the handiwork, and I must say it is a cake to <i>die</i> for." The butler eyes me, waiting for a response. Max slaps his shoulder, grinning at him. "Old chap, your wit simply has no end!"
        Max reaches the end of the hall and turns around, resting against a heavy metallic door. I smell something like strawberries. 
        ** [Kitchen]"This is the kitchen?"
            "Now <i>there’s</i> that detective brain of yours! Come on in."
