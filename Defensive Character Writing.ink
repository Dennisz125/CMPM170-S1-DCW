===Intro===
    The brisk autumn air nips at the crevices and creases of my weathered face as I recheck the notes I had written to myself earlier this morning. A coffee stain conceals the latter half of the address. 
    <i>This must be the place.</i>
    I trudge up the driveway of my childhood friendâ€™s newly acquired mansion, my footsteps crunching against the hard gravel. A man dressed up in a tuxedo and top hat walks out to greet me, arms outstretched. 
    "Old sport, you've arrived! Come in, come in. I've an extravagant cake prepared, just for the occasion." 
    "Don't call me that." 
    Maximilian smiles and shakes his head, muttering, "No promises, old friend." 
    "Never mind that. Erm, you've done quite well for yourself. Lovely place. Say, whose truck is that outside?"
    "Ah, Mr. Ex! My specialist! I'm having the place cleansed of some dark energy. It's only routine maintenance, really." 
    "Cleansed? Now don't tell me you've fallen for that mumbo jumbo." 
    "Oh, you just have to see for yourself. You'll feel the difference. Now, follow me into the foyer, we must get started on preparations for the evening! My butler will take your coat... Er, where is that chap anyway? Never mind, just hand it to me, I'll take care of it."
    I slip off my coat and hand it to Maximilian as we step inside.
