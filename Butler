    {(not butler_met):
        An imposing man stands with his back against the white walls of the foyer. I had nearly mistaken him for a statue until we briefly made eye contact. The gray bristles of his moustache appear to stick straight down, as if recently combed by a careful hand.

         "The evening has nearly concluded and yet you still remain ignorant as to my identity? And you fancy yourself a private investigator?"
        }
        The Butler stares down at me, sharpening a chef's knife that I assume originated from the kitchen. I have a difficult time assessing whether he is annoyed with me or simply tired of the whole ordeal. 
            ** [Name] "Haven't heard your name yet. Care to enlighten me?"
                "I do not know why you insist upon asking questions in such a manner... But I will humor you. I am Bartholomew Murderman.
                ...Aha. Of course, that last bit was a jest, detective. I digress. Most people simply refer to me as 'The Butler.' You may do the same."

        "You're joking, yes? I am his butler, or have you already forgotten?"
            ** [Party] "Do you know why Maximilian has prepared this gathering?" 
            "Is it not obvious? He truly loves his dear friend... Kidding, of course. If you are so very interested in the truth, I might allow you to hear some of it. 
            Sir Maximilian has become quite the paranoiac, seeing ghosts in his halls... But you shouldn't put so much stock in rumors, right, Detective? Why, after all, would you trust the butler?"

    * {not Time and butler_who} [Cake] "I heard from my friend that cake will be served."
        "You are correct. 
        ...Were you expecting me to elaborate? Hmph. Very well. The cake has been created in Sir Maximilian's image. You should see it. It's quite... something."
        The Butler's eyes fall down to the knife in his hands, and the corners of his mouth twitch upwards in an odd grin. 
        "I'll need something sharp to cut it with," he says, holding up the knife for me to get a closer look.
