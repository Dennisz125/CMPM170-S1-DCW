    {(not butler_met):
        An imposing man stands with his back against the white walls of the foyer. I had nearly mistaken him for a statue until we briefly made eye contact. The gray bristles of his moustache appear to stick straight down, as if recently combed by a careful hand. 
            ~ butler_met = true
    - else: 
        The Butler. Ugh... 
    }
    
    
    // ---- QUESTIONS ---- 
    
    
    // -- WHO --
    * [Butler] "Who are you?"
        {Time hasnt Eight and Time hasnt Nine: 
        "Hoh hoh. Is it not clear? I am the butler of this estate. I thought it would be apparent to a pretend detective such as yourself."
        - else: 
         "The evening has nearly concluded and yet you still remain ignorant as to my identity? And you fancy yourself a private investigator?"
        }
        The Butler stares down at me, sharpening a chef's knife that I assume originated from the kitchen. I have a difficult time assessing whether he is annoyed with me or simply tired of the whole ordeal. 
        ++ -> Butler
    
    
    // -- NAME --
    * [Name] "Haven't heard your name yet. Care to enlighten me?"
        "I do not know why you insist upon asking questions in such a manner... But I will humor you. I am Bartholomew Murderman.
        ...Aha. Of course, that last bit was a jest, detective. I digress. Most people simply refer to me as 'The Butler.' You may do the same." 
        ++ -> Butler
    
    
    // -- CAKE -- 
    // TODO how is the cake being tracked? when Time is empty, is the game taking place before the "body" is found?     
    * {not Time} [Cake] "I heard from my friend that cake will be served."
        "You are correct. 
        ...Were you expecting me to elaborate? Hmph. Very well. The cake has been created in Sir Maximilian's image. You should see it. It's quite... something."
        The Butler's eyes fall down to the knife in his hands, and the corners of his mouth twitch upwards in an odd grin. 
        "I'll need something sharp to cut it with," he says, holding up the knife for me to get a closer look.

        - else:
            "I am politely requesting that you cease your inquiries."
            He's looking at that knife again...
