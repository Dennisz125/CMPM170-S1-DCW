    {
    - BPlot == BPlotList.None: 
        Maximillian sits dejectedly at the dining table. As I approach he looks at me earnestly.
    - BPlot == BPlotList.Seance: 
        Maximillian has cleared some space at the table before him, eyes closed and quietly humming as he rests his hands on the planchette of an ancient looking Oujia board. I give him a quick tap on the shoulder to get his attention, making him jump nearly out of his seat. He turns sheepishly to greet me.
    - BPlot == BPlotList.Exorcist: 
    It seems that the 'Exorcist' has Maximillian convinced of a supernatural threat. Maximillian, burning sage and Bible in hand, is making rounds in the Dining Room, attempting to... well I'm not even sure what he'd be hoping to accomplish. As I catch his attention he quickly comes over, and douses me in pungent smoke. He waits for my coughing fit to end before he continues:

    "Any word, old friend?"
    -> Talk

    ===Talk===

    //Final accusation, needs to send to conclusion, need conclusion.
    * {RaccoonKnowledge == RaccoonKnowledgeList.Dunnit and CakeList == CakeList.RaccoonIn} [I've solved the murder!]
        "I've solved the case! It would seem you're overpaying your friend, the Exorterminator over there. A raccoon snuck in through the kitchen window earlier. Seems like it found your cake just as appetizing as the rest of us."
        Maximillian looks at me with disbelief in his eyes.
        "If you don't believe me I'll show you, old friend"
        ++-> Ending

    //Update BPlot
    *{BPlot == BPlotList.Seance} "Um... What's with the getup, Max?"
        "A recommendation from my devoted Exorcist. I've had quite enough of these paranormal happenings, and he says that a touch of mysticism is exactly what we need!"
        ++-> Talk

    //
    *{BPlot == BPlotList.Exorcist} I'm starting to get really tired of all this 'mysticism'. "Contacting the dead not enough for you, eh Max?"
        He seems a little shocked at my exasperation. "Now, now, Old Pal. I pay Mr. X good money for his services, you ought to have a little bit more <i>faith</i> in his skills." Maximillian can't help but grin as he gestures to the Bible in his hand.
        <i>Well, at least we know he'll survive this ordeal with a sense of humor in tact...</i>
        ++-> Talk

    //Ask for more info about Butler
    *{butler_who == true}"Tell me more about your Butler. Mr.... Murderman."
        "Bartholomew? He can seem a bit cold, but he's been a butler to my family for generations. I trust him completely."
        ++-> Talk

    //Ask for more info about Exterminator
    *{exterminator_who == true}"Tell me more about your friend there. Mr. X, was it?"
        "Ah, yes! Since I was a boy the halls of this place have given me the chills. Since I came into possession of the estate it only got worse, so I sought the assistance of a specialist. He quickly confirmed the presence of malevolent spirits here, but he assures me it's nothing a regular cleansing can't solve."
        Mr. X's presence here seems to Maximillian at ease. Unfortunately, that would make him the only one...
        ++-> Talk

    //Investigation
    *{RaccoonKnowledge == RaccoonKnowledgeList.OutsideInfluence and Cake == CakeList.Some} "I found evidence of an intruder in your home, Max. Maybe the killer is someone else entirely..."
        "Or some<i>THING</i>! I knew Mr. X was onto something! Don't you worry old chap, you can leave this to the professional!"
        Maximillian looks over to Mr. X, who is currently devouring a chicken leg.
        "We're in capable hands!"
        ++-> Talk

    *{RaccoonKnowledge == RaccoonKnowledgeList.Dunnit and Cake != CakeList.RaccoonIn} "It seems a raccoon got in the house earlier, I believe this furry bandit may be the one who killed the cake."
        "Nonesense! Mr. X is more than just a capable exorcist, but also my exterminator. He's purged this home of spirit and pest alike! Oh no, my friend, I'll believe this ridiculous tale when I see it. A raccoon, <i>HA!</i>"
        <i>Max seems thoroughly convinced of a supernatural threat. I guess I'll have to find the frosting-covered critter to make him see reason</i>
        ++-> Talk

    //Cake updates, let him know the cake got worse
    *{Cake == CakeList.Blood or Cake == CakeList.Trail} "I have bad news, Max..."
        Maximillian gives a pitiable look. I almost feel bad for having to break this news to him...
        "About the cake... It seems the killer struck again."
        Max lets out a wail, throwing himself around me and sobbing into my shoulder.
        <i>Oh geez</i>
        "My poor, absolutely delicious visage! My party has been murdered along with it! Tell me you can catch the killer, old chap!"
        I grab him by the shoulders and firmly remove his snotty face from my jacket.
        <i>I hope that comes out later...</i>
        "Listen, Max. We've been friends for as long as I can remember, and nobody gets away with taking your head off while I'm around."
        He seems to cheer up a bit, wiping away snot and tears on the sleeve of his tuxedo. "If I ever get brutally murdered I want you to be the one on the case"
        "Um... Thanks?"
